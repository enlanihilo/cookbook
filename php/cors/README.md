CORS = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
Origin = protocol://hostname:portNumber
Resource = data

CORS means : Requests from 1 origin to another origin in order to fetch data (share resources).

so basically CORS is a defense mechanism, a restriction within a browser that prevents a origin from making requests to another random origin
