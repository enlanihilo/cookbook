### What is make
A tool which controls the generation of executables from source files.
it reads the instructions of how to build a program from a file called
*makefile* 

### Make capabilities:
- automatic configuration/updates
- not limited to a specific language nor a package

### Rules and Targets

A simple makefile consists of **rules** with the following shape:

```
target:  dependencies ...
		 commands
		 ...
```

where **target** is the name of the file or action;

##### Conventions

filename = makefile or Makefile
$@ = name of the file to be made
$* = prefix shared by target/dependent files
$< = name of related file that caused the action
$? = names of changed dependents
CC = compiling c
CXX = compiling c++


### Makefiles Examples

```
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-I
DEPS = hellomake.h				
OBJ = hellomake.o hellofunc.o	

%.o: %.c $(DEPS)
	$(CC) -o $@ $< $(CCFLAGS)
```
